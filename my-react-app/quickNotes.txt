This file contains quick some notes about React.

-> React is library of js not a framework.
-> React was a class based components language but now its a functional components based language.


Accessing Js in return statemnt:
-> to write html in return you need (), to write javascript in return statement you need {}.
similarly in order to access variables in return statement use {}

for eg: const food1 =  "Apple";
        const food2 = "Mango";

            return (
                    <ul>
                         <li>Grapes</li>
                        <li>{food1}</li>
                    </ul>
                     );


-> can use the components by making functions and calling them


-> in App.js we cannot return more than one tag at a time, loophole to this is to make a empty tag
and return every desired tag in that, calling the respective function in that order


-> With .jsx files we use 'className' to assign class to a tag rather than 'class'  keyword
