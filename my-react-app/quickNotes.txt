This file contains quick some notes about React.

-> React is library of js not a framework.
-> React was a class based components language but now its a functional components based language.


Accessing Js in return statemnt:
-> to write html in return you need (), to write javascript in return statement you need {}.
similarly in order to access variables in return statement use {}

for eg: const food1 =  "Apple";
        const food2 = "Mango";

            return (
                    <ul>
                         <li>Grapes</li>
                        <li>{food1}</li>
                    </ul>
                     );


-> can use the components by making functions and calling them
